# ROUND TO ANY

###### Useful information 

This folder contains python scripts useful for those wishing to round numbers in Python to any value in a given interval range. 

Currently the scripts only do this for single values at a time but will in future be updated to round arrays.

**round_to_any.py** contains the class and should be imported to a relevant script before running.
